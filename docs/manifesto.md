## A Manifesto for Verifiable Computation

---

We are at the end of an era defined by trust‑by‑authority.

Modern computation—machine learning, scientific simulation, finance, AI governance—runs on an assumption: results are honest because they come from powerful institutions, prestigious labs, or expensive hardware.

That assumption is no longer sufficient.

Scale has outpaced trust.

---

The core problem is not intelligence.

It is **unverifiability**.

---

Probabilistically Checkable and Mechanically Provable computation (PCMP) is not about making computation smarter or more correct.

It is about making dishonesty impossible to hide.

It reframes computation from **"trust me"** to **"verify me"**.

Not later.
Not socially.
But cryptographically and mechanically.

---

PCMP asserts a simple principle:

Any claim about computation that matters should be cheaply verifiable by anyone, regardless of who performed it.

This is not a performance optimization.

It is a moral shift.

---

Today’s systems fail silently.

Bugs.
Data leakage.
Prompt injection.
Gradient hacking.
Silent fine‑tuning.
Unverifiable checkpoints.
Non‑deterministic training artifacts.
Opaque inference paths.

All collapse into one reality:

**Power without Proof.**

---

PCMP removes authority from the loop.

Under PCMP, systems do not earn trust by reputation, scale, or branding.

They earn trust by producing artifacts that prove:
- what was computed  
- how it was computed  
- under which constraints  
- without revealing secrets  
- without requiring trust in the executor

---

This applies to:
- AI training and fine‑tuning  
- Scientific computation  
- Financial systems  
- Cloud inference  
- Decentralized systems  
- Regulatory compliance  
- Safety‑critical software

---

PCMP does not solve alignment.
It does not solve intelligence.
It does not solve ethics.

It solves something more fundamental.

**Accountability at Machine Speed.**

---

If a system is correct, it can prove it.

If it cannot prove it, it does not deserve trust.

---

This is not anti‑innovation.

It is anti‑bullshit.

---

The future will not be won by the biggest models, the fastest GPUs, or the loudest marketing.

It will be won by systems that can withstand adversarial scrutiny without collapsing into appeals to authority.

---

PCMP is not optional.

It is the end state of computation once trust becomes scarce.

---

# Truth must become verifiable — or it will become irrelevant
